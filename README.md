Functional Requirements
Objective : This app is specifically designed for medical practitioners and their patients. It helps the
doctors track information about their patients as well as appointments. Patients will be able to see
what’s available in terms of dates and times. On the other side, the administrator will be able to
cancel, edit or make appointments and patient information.
End-Result: This app will have features that allow the user to view available appointments dates.
There will also be a feature where they put in their information once they have made an
appointment that the doctor can see before meeting with the patient. On the other side, the
administrator which is the medical practitioner or their PA will be able to make, cancel or edit
appointments and patient information.
The user will be required to input their contact details, age, gender and BMI, symptoms they are
currently experiencing and why they would like to see the doctor. The user might also like to be able
to make some changes to their bookings but at this point only the administrator will be able to do
that. When the administrator modifies the user’s appointment, it will immediately send them an
email notifying them of the changes that have been made.
