Before I start developing my app, I am going to start with the design phase which entails UX/UI Design/Research. This phase allowed me to determine who exactly I am designing for and from there I was able to determine the web stack I will be using for the development of my application. For this application, I will be using MERN stack as it provides quick scalability. In my experience, MERN stack tools have allowed me to write code quicker and efficiently. This gives me time to focus on other issues such as adding new features according to user specifications and resolving any issues that may arise withing my program. 
MERN stack is suitable for programs of any size and complexity therefore this gives me room to play around where these particular factors are concerned. MERN stack has quite a community and is more popular because of it’s functionality. It simplifies code, it be front or back-end. 
I am going to deploy the app on Heroku. From my experience with using Heroku, it allows manual horizontal and vertical scaling. It’s easy to use and quite straightforward. 
I used Figma and AdobeXd to design and from there used React library to create the frontend. With this, there will also be Javascript for dynamic web pages and HTML. CSS will also be used, for styling. I will be using Create React App.
