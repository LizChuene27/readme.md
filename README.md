Before I start coding my app, I started with the design phase which entails UX/UI Design/Research. This phase allowed me to determine who exactly I am developing the product for. Upon determining who I will develping the product for, I was also able to determine the web stack I will be using for the development of my application. For this application, I will be using MERN stack as it provides quick scalability. In my experience, MERN stack tools have allowed me to write code quicker and efficiently. This gives me time to focus on other issues such as adding new features according to user specifications and resolving any issues that may arise withing my program. MERN stack is suitable for programs of any size and complexity therefore this gives me room to play around where these particular factors are concerned. MERN stack has quite a community and is more popular because of it’s functionality. It simplifies code, it be front or back-end. 

I completed a competitor analysis research where I was able to narrow down two softwares that are similar to the one I am trying to build. Medapp is one app that allow users to book their doctor's appointment online. My product will be easier to use and have a more friendlier UI which my competitors don't have. My product will not only cover general practitioners but will also have chiropractors, orthodontists, opthalmologists and other specialists. My product will also work on location basis. Wherever the user goes, it will pick up the location automatically through an API and give them doctors in that area. UI will be simplified so anyone can easily navigate and be able to book an appointment.

I am going to deploy the app on Heroku. From my experience with using Heroku, it allows manual horizontal and vertical scaling. It’s easy to use and quite straightforward. 
I used Figma and AdobeXd to design and React library to create the frontend. With this, there will also be Javascript for dynamic web pages and HTML. CSS will also be used, for styling. I will make use of Create React App to create my app. 

Non Functional Requirements :
•	Usability : users will have to download the app. To be able to use it, they will have to create an account. They can create an account using email, using Facebook or their Apple account. They will be required to enter a password and they will be sent an email to verify their accounts. Upon verification, they will be required to login and upon successful login, they will access dash board. They will be able to see doctors in their local area, be able to choose specialist if need be, choose date and time based on what’s available.
•	Reliability: If the user forgot their password, there will be an option to reset which is just one click away. Should they enter incorrect pin, they will also be locked out at third attempt. When they click om forgot password, they will be sent a link to reset to their registered email addresses. When a doctor isn’t available, on the calendar, all their booked dates will be grayed out.
•	Performance: Once the user successfully logins into the app, they will be prompted to choose a doctor. Within 10 seconds, all the doctors in their area will pop up. As soon as they click on a certain doctor, they will be taken on the schedule screen where they can choose their time slots. To successfully book an appointment, it takes roughly 10 minutes. Upon successfully scheduling an appointment, they will get a confirmation SMS.
•	Security: There will be OTPs sent to their phones for any logins on their registered cellphones.

Functional Requirements:
•	The app will allow users to view a number of doctors in  their area.
•	Doctors will be able to register themselves on the app so as to appear
•	The users will be able to select a day and time that best suits them provided, the doctor is available at that time.
•	The user will also be required to input the symptoms they are expensive to allow the doctor to prepare beforehand.
